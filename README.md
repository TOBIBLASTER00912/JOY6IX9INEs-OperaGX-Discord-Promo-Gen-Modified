## Overview

This Python script allows you to generate discord promo links. It utilizes threading for concurrent generation, and you have the option to use proxies to avoid rate limits. (Edit by TOBIBLASTER0912: I recommend doing 1 Thread so you dont get ratelimited that fast.)

## Features

- Multi-threaded promo code generation
- Proxy support to bypass rate limits
- User-friendly console interface

## How to Use

1. Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

2. Enter proxies in proxies.txt in the following format:
```ruby
username:password@host:port
```

3. Run the Script:
```bash
python gen.py
```
4. Enter the number of threads when prompted.
